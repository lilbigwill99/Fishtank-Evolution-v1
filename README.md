Fishtank Evolution is a program designed to take 2d "fish" and machine learning and simulate evolution by having those fish seek
food to survive by using actions they have decided on. It starts with a randomly generated tank, filled with unintelligent fish.
Over time, the fish will develop skills to survive in the tank. Less fortunate fish are removed and replaced with the offspring of 
the two best fish currently in the tank, leading to a better average fitness overtime.
